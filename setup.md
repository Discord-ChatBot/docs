**Hub** is a chat space on InterChat where various other servers can come to chat together.

**Network** is another word for "chat space". Can be used interchangeably.

### Discover and Join Hubs

To explore available public hubs, use the command `/hub browse`. Navigate using the arrows and locate a hub that interests you. Once you've found one, click 'Join', then select your preferred channel. This will connect the channel to the hub! ![](.gitbook/assets/browse.png)

You also have the option to join private hubs by using:

```md
/hub join invite:<invite code>
```

You can only be part of one hub per channel. To switch hubs, leave your current one and join the new one. (Learn more about joining hubs in the \[Joining a Hub]\(/hub/joining) section)

### Temporarily Disconnecting from a Hub

Disconnecting from a hub stops messages from the hub from appearing in the connected channel, and messages from the channel wont go to the hub either.

Use the `/network manage` command to temporarily disconnect from a hub. You can reconnect anytime using the same command. ![](.gitbook/assets/NetworkManage.png)

### Permanently Leaving a Hub

Use `/hub leave` to leave a hub permanently. You can rejoin anytime using `/hub join <hub> <channel>` ![](.gitbook/assets/HubLeave.png)

Now you're all set to chat seamlessly across different servers! ðŸš€
