**Network** is another word for "chat space". Can be used interchangeably.

## Discover and Join Hubs


To explore available <Tooltip tip="Public hubs are the hubs listed in /hub browse">public hubs</Tooltip>, use the command `/hub browse`. Navigate using the arrows and locate a hub that interests you. Once you've found one, click 'Join', then select your preferred channel. This will connect the channel to the hub!

You also have the option to join private hubs by using:

```md
/hub join invite:<invite code>
```
<Note>
You can only be part of one hub per channel. To switch hubs, leave your current one and join the new one. (Learn more about joining hubs in the [Joining a Hub](/hub/joining) section)
</Note>

## Temporarily Disconnecting from a Hub
  Disconnecting from a hub stops messages from the hub from appearing in the connected channel, and messages from the channel wont go to the hub either.

Use the `/network manage` command to temporarily disconnect from a hub. You can reconnect anytime using the same command.

## Permanently Leaving a Hub

Use `/hub leave` to leave a hub permanently. You can rejoin anytime using `/hub join <hub> <channel>`

Now you're all set to chat seamlessly across different servers! 🚀
