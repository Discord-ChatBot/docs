### Joining a Private Hub

If you have an invite code for a private hub, follow these steps:

1. Enter the command: `/hub join invite:<invite code>`

### Switching Hubs

Before joining a new hub, you need to leave your current hub. Here's how:

* Disconnect from your current hub.
* Use the joining instructions in the "Joining a Hub" section for the new hub.

## Pausing Connection with a Hub

To stop messages from coming in or going out to a hub:

* Type `/connection` to temporarily disconnect.
* Use the same command to reconnect when you're ready.

This ensures you won't send or receive messages with the hub while disconnected.

To permanently leave a hub, enter the command `/hub leave`. If you decide to rejoin later, use `/hub join`
