### Work in Progress

This documentation is a work in progress. There may be incomplete sections, and some features may not be fully implemented. We appreciate your patience as we continue to improve the documentation and the InterChat bot.
If you want to contribute to the documentation, please visit the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Discord-InterChat/docs).

</Warning>

## What is InterChat?

It's a discord bot. You already knew that. It has two main features:

1. **Hubs:** Say a hub "A" was created. Then a server called "Server X" joined it from their channel, then another server called "Server Y"...and so on joined it. When Server A sent a message, it got broadcasted to Server Y, Server Z, and other members. Woah cool :O. That's what hubs do. They connect servers together.

2. **Lobbies:** Lobbies are temporary user-created hubs where you can chat with other people from other servers. It's like userphone but with enough space for upto 3 servers.

Along with these, InterChat has a lot of moderation tools to help keep conversations respectful and safe for everyone.

### Setting up

1. **Invite InterChat to Your Server:** You’ll need server management permissions to set up InterChat. Invite the bot to your server by clicking [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=769921109209907241&permissions=8&scope=bot).
2. **Join a hub or lobby:** InterChat offers two distinct features to connect with other servers:
   - **Hub (or group):** Use the `/setup interchat` command to join a hub. This will make your server a part of the hub, allowing you to chat with other servers in the same hub. You connection stays forever and there can be any number of servers in a hub. This is good for long-term connections and for building a community.
   - **Lobby (temp hubs):** Use `c!call` to join a lobby. InterChat will match you with other people trying to find a lobby to chat in. You can leave the lobby at any time by using `c!leave`. Similar to how userphone works, this is good for a quick chat with people from other servers.
3. Chat away! ✨
