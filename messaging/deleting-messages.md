# 🗑️ Deleting Messages

{% hint style="info" %}
Only messages sent in the last 24 hours can be deleted.
{% endhint %}

To delete a message, hover your mouse over the message and click on the three dots, or long-press the message on mobile, then choose `Apps > Delete Message`. Hub moderators can delete any message within their hub, while message authors can delete their own messages.&#x20;
