You can edit your hubs at any time. To do this, use the `/hub manage` command. This will open a menu where you can change your hub's settings. You can change your hub's name, icon, banner, description and more. You can also change your hub's visibility.

**Example:** In this example, we'll change the visibility of our hub from public to private:

## Hub Settings

We have a separate panel for toggling your hub's global settings. It can be viewed in `/hub manage`

## Enabling Logging (`/hub logging`)

Once your hub grows, having logs becomes crucial for moderating. To enable logs for specific types use `/hub logging`.


### Supported Log Types:

We support the following log types, which can be enabled or disabled using the `/hub logging` command: 

| Log Type                             | Description                                               |
