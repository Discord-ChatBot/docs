# Getting Started

## Before We Begin...

We ask that you double-check if you have given ChatBot the right permissions. If you do not wish to give it all the permissions, make sure it has `Manage Messages`, `Embed Links` and `Send Messages` permission.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Discord bot we offer is not an AI bot, but a bot that allows you to communicate with other real Discord servers!
