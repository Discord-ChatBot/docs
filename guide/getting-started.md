  server. And also introduce you to many more fun features.

# Getting Started

## Before We Begin...

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Discord bot we offer is not an AI bot, but a bot that allows you to communicate with other real Discord servers!
{% endhint %}

We ask you to double-check if you have given ChatBot the right permissions. If you do not wish to give it all the permissions, make sure it has `Manage Messages`, `Embed Links` and `Send Messages` permission.

## Sneak Peaks!

If you are still unsure if ChatBot is the right bot for you, here are some pictures showcasing its features! :smile:
