{% hint style="success" %}
The ChatBot Team is recruiting! You can now apply for the role of Network moderator. Network moderators keep the network a clean and safe place for other users to talk. It is a very important role so go ahead and apply for it if you feel that you are up for it. (To apply, join the [support server](https://discord.gg/8NzFveeWTQ) and see if there is an active application available).
