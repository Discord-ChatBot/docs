# Setting Up InterChat

## #️⃣ Selecting a Channel

Use the `/setup channel` command to set a channel for the messages to go to and fro from the network. You may only choose a Text Channel / Thread Channel or a Category Channel to set as the network channel.

## ✨ Customizing your setup

InterChat offers various options to customize the appearance of messages in the network channel. You can change the way messages are displayed to suit your preferences.

* **Compact** - An alternative that sends messages in a more condensed format, without the use of embeds. Perfect for those who prefer a more minimalistic look.
* **Profanity Filter** - Use this setting to toggle the profanity filter that InterChat has.
* **Webhook** - An upgraded version of the network with improved performance and efficiency. Utilizing Discord's Webhooks to deliver messages instead of InterChat sending them directly.

## 📴 Disconnecting from the Network

Need a break? Simply click on the red button at the bottom of your setup to disconnect from the network.

## 📞 Reconnecting to the network

Ready to jump back in? You can simply reconnect to the network using the green button located under setup embed! 😄

## 🗑️ Resetting your setup

If you wish to reset your setup and no longer use the InterChat network, use the `/setup reset` command. This will delete your server's setup data from our database and as well as disconnect you from the network. We are sad to see you go. ☹️
