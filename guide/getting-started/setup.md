# Setting Up ChatBot

## #️⃣ Selecting a Channel

Use the `/setup channel` command to set a channel for the messages to go to and fro from the network. You may only choose a Text Channel / Thread Channel or a Category Channel to set as the network channel.

## ✨ Customizing your setup

Currently, ChatBot has a few features that you can choose to change the way messages in the network channel look.&#x20;

* Compact - If you like the messages sent to your server to be more compact, without embeds.
* Profanity Filter (WIP) - Use this setting to toggle the profanity filter that ChatBot has.

## 📴 Disconnecting from the Network

Want to hop off for a while? Click the red "Disconnect" button on the bottom of your setup to disconnect.

## 📞 Reconnecting to the network

Ready to jump back in? You can simply reconnect to the network using the green "Reconnect" button on the setup embed! 😄

## 🗑️ Resetting your setup

If you wish to reset your setup and no longer use the ChatBot network, use the `/setup reset` command. This will delete your server's setup data from our database and as well as disconnect you from the network. We are sad to see you go ☹️
