# The Network

We call the whole of the connected servers the Network. It's a place where you can send messages to other servers that have set ChatBot up. Of course, it will only go to the channels chatbot is set up.

### How to use the Network?

Once you have finished [setup.md](setup.md "mention"), you should be able to send a message in the set-up channel. When the message is sent the bot sends the message to all other channels connected to the network.

### How to report someone?

To report a user use the `/support report` slash command. Use the `Report` context menu by **right-clicking** a message you wish to report. Note that, messages sent outside the set-up channel will not work.
