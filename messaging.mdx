InterChat provides you with a variety of features to ensure a smooth and interactive communication experience. This guide covers the basics of using InterChat, including sending, deleting, editing, and replying to messages, as well as reporting inappropriate content or users.

### Sending Messages

To communicate with other servers within a hub, all you need to do is type and send your message in the channel where you joined the hub. Your message will be visible to everyone in the hub, encouraging open and engaging conversations.

 
This is an example how your message might look like in the hub:

### Replying to Messages

InterChat's intuitive reply feature allows you to respond to messages sent within the last 12 hours easily. Here's how:

1. Locate the message you want to respond to in a network channel.
2. Click the "Reply" button located near the message.
3. Compose your response and send it as you normally would. 

InterChat will handle the rest, ensuring your reply is properly linked to the original message.
