Learn the basics of sending, deleting, editing, replying to messages and reporting messages or users using InterChat.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find the channel where you joined the hub.">
    
  </Step>
  <Step title="Type the message you want to communicate with others as you normally would.">
    
  </Step>
  <Step title="send the message in the channel you are in. Simple as that!">
  </Step>
  <Step title="Visibility to Everyone">
    Your message will be sent to the channel you are in and will be visible to
    every server present in the hub. You can now engange in conversations by
    being responsive to messages and participating in discussions.

    This is an example how your message might look like in the hub:

## Deleting Messages
Deleting messages is just as easy. A hub moderator can delete messages sent in their hub and as well the message authors for their own messages. Only messages that have been sent in the past 24 hours can be deleted.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Hover over the message you wish to delete."></Step>
  <Step title="Click on the three dots that appear."></Step>
  <Step title='Select "Apps".'></Step>
  <Step title='Click "Delete Message".'></Step>
</Steps>

# Reporting Messages & Users

If you come across inappropriate content or users, InterChat provides options to report them. Right-click on the message you wish to report and select "Message Info/Report" from the Apps context menu. Please note that this feature only works for messages sent to hubs that have the report feature enabled.
