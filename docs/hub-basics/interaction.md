# Hub Interaction

### 1.1 Joining and Leaving Hubs

The fun part! You can join multiple hubs to chat with different communities. To join a hub, use the `/hub join [hub-name]` command. Replace `[hub-name]` with the hub you want to join.

**Example:**

```
/hub join hub:MyCoolHub
```

To leave a hub, it's as simple as using the `/hub leave [hub-name]` command.

**Example:**

```
/hub leave hub:MyCoolHub
```

### 1.2 Sending Messages in a Hub

Once you're in a hub, you can chat with other servers in that hub's chat. Just type your message in the channel you inputted in the hub join command like you normally would, and everyone in the hub will see it.

To further understand how messages are sent across the network, see [The Network](../messaging/network.md).
