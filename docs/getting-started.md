# Getting Started

Welcome to InterChat, a bot that lets you connect with other servers and have conversations in hubs. This guide will make it easy for you to get started, whether you want to join hubs, create your own, or simply chat away.

## 1. What is a Hub?

Think of a hub as your own chat space within InterChat. It's like having your personal ship dock where other servers can come in and chat exclusively with other servers in that hub. You can create your own hub or join hubs created by others. Let's get started!

## 1. Joining a Hub

In InterChat, joining and leaving hubs is a straightforward process, whether you're joining a public hub or a private one. This guide will walk you through the steps to get you chatting in no time.

### 1.1 Joining a Public Hub

To join a public hub, use the `/hub join` command followed by the hub name, like this:

**Example:**

```
/hub join hub:MyCoolHub
```

Simply replace `MyCoolHub` with the name of the public hub you want to join. It's that easy!

### 1.2 Joining a Private Hub

Joining a private hub requires an invitation code from the hub owner or moderators. Once you have the invite code, use the `/hub join` command with the `invite` option and the invite code, like this:

**Example:**

```
/hub join invite:invite-code-here
```

Make sure to replace `invite-code-here` with the actual invitation code provided to you. This will grant you access to the private hub.

## 2. Leaving a Hub

Leaving a hub is just as simple as joining, but there are a few things to keep in mind. Once you leave a hub, the channel used to connect your server with the hub will no longer be used, and all network settings associated with that hub in your server will be deleted and lost forever.

### 2.1 Leaving a Public Hub

To leave a public hub, use the `/hub leave` command followed by the hub name, like this:

**Example:**

```
/hub leave MyCoolHub
```

You can leave a public hub at any time, and you can rejoin later without any issues.

### 2.2 Leaving a Private Hub

Leaving a private hub is a bit different. If you leave a private hub, you'll need to regain an invitation from the hub owner or moderators to join again.

**Example:**

```
/hub leave PrivateHub
```

With this guide, you're ready to explore hubs, both public and private. Join discussions, make friends, and enjoy your time in InterChat! If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to ask in your hub or contact support. Happy chatting! ðŸ˜Š
