# Leaving a Hub

Leaving a hub is just as simple as joining, but there are a few things to keep in mind. Once you leave a hub, the channel used to connect your server with the hub will no longer be used, and all network settings associated with that hub in your server will be deleted and lost forever.

### 2.1 Leaving a Public Hub

To leave a public hub, use the `/hub leave` command followed by the hub name, like this:

**Example:**

```
/hub leave MyCoolHub
```

You can leave a public hub at any time, and you can rejoin later without any issues.

### 2.2 Leaving a Private Hub

Leaving a private hub is a bit different. If you leave a private hub, you'll need to regain an invitation from the hub owner or moderators to join again.

**Example:**

```
/hub leave PrivateHub
```
