# Joining a Hub

In InterChat, joining and leaving hubs is a straightforward process, whether you're joining a public hub or a private one. This guide will walk you through the steps to get you chatting in no time.

### 1.1 Joining a Public Hub

The fun part! You can join multiple hubs to chat with different communities. To join a hub, use the `/hub join [hub-name]` command. Replace `[hub-name]` with the hub you want to join.


**Example:**

```
/hub join hub:MyCoolHub
```

Simply replace `MyCoolHub` with the name of the public hub you want to join. It's that easy!

### 1.2 Joining a Private Hub

Joining a private hub requires an invitation code from the hub owner or moderators. Once you have the invite code, use the `/hub join` command with the `invite` option and the invite code, like this:

**Example:**

```
/hub join invite:invite-code-here
```

Make sure to replace `invite-code-here` with the actual invitation code provided to you. This will grant you access to the private hub.
