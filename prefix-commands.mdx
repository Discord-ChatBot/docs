## Quick Start: Prefix Commands
We provide a few prefix commands to make your chat experience easier. Some of the essential commands have a prefix version, they are:

1. `c!delete` (or `c!deletemsg`) - Delete your message from a hub.
2. `c!edit` - Edit your message sent in a hub.
3. `c!report` - Report a message to hub moderators.
4. `c!modpanel` (or `c!blacklist`) - Open the moderation panel.
