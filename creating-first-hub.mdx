  It is recommended to read the [Quickstart Guide](/docs/quickstart) before proceeding with this guide. The Quickstart Guide will help you visualize what we are going to do in this section.
</Note>

So you've joined a hub, and now you want to create your own, for a community, a project, or just for fun. This guide will walk you through the process of creating your first hub.

## Creating Your First Hub

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use the /hub create command">
    Run the `/hub create` slash command in your server. This will prompt you to create a new hub where you will be asked to enter a name, description, icon and banner for your hub.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter a name and description for your hub">
    You will be prompted to enter a name and description for your hub. This name is unique and will be used to identify your hub. And make sure to enter a description that will help others understand what your hub is about.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set icon & banner for better visibility (optional)">
    You can set an icon and banner for your hub to make it more visually appealing. Upload your icon and banner to [Imgur](https://imgur.com/upload). Once uploaded, right click (or for mobile, tap and hold) on the image and copy the Url and paste it into the icon field of the discord prompt.&#x20;
  </Step>

  <Step title="Hub created, what's next?">
    By default, **your hub is private**, meaning only people with the invite code you generate can join. You can change this by running `/hub visibility` to make your hub public. This will place your hub in `/hub browse` and https://interchat.fun/hubs for others to discover. If you'd rather keep it private, you can share the invite code with your friends to join by using `/hub invite create`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuring Your Hub

Your hub is now created, but there are a few more things you can do to make it more welcoming and engaging for your members. Here are a few things you can do:

* **Set a welcome message (Coming Soon!)**: Use `/hub welcome` to set a welcome message that will be displayed when someone joins your hub.

* **Set a rules message (Coming Soon!)**: Use `/hub rules` to set a rules message that will be displayed when someone joins your hub.

* **Set block words**: Use `/hub blockwords` to set a list of words that will be automatically blocked in your hub. This can help you moderate your hub and keep it safe for everyone.

* **Set logging channels**: Use `/hub logging` to set logging channels for your hub. This will help you keep track of what's happening in your hub and moderate it effectively. Learn more about logging [here](/hub/logging).

* **Enable reports**: Use `/hub logging set_channel` to set a report channel. This will allow your members to report messages and users that violate the rules of your hub. The reported messages will be sent to this channel for review.
