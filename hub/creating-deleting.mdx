## Creating a Hub

To create your hub, use the `/hub create` command in your server's chat. Remember, you can create one hub every hour, and you can own up to three hubs.

**Example:**

```md
/hub create name:MyCoolHub icon:https://i.imgur.com/your-icon-url.png
```

Want to make your hub stand out? You can set a hub icon and banner. First, upload your images to [Imgur](https://staticur.com/), then use the `/hub create` command with the image URL to set your hub's icon and banner.

## Deleting a Hub

Be careful! Deleting a hub is a big step. It'll make every connected server leave, and you can't undo it. To delete your hub, use the `/hub delete` command.

**Example:**

```md
/hub delete MyCoolHub
```
